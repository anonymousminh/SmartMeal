# SmartMeal: 15-Day AI Meal & Grocery Planner Project Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive 15-day development plan for the SmartMeal project, an AI-powered meal and grocery planner. The plan is designed for the AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon and includes a day-by-day task breakdown, along with a recommended GitHub commit strategy to ensure consistent progress and a well-documented codebase.

## Project Overview

**Name:** SmartMeal – AI Meal & Grocery Planner

**Core Functionality:**

*   Suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients and dietary preferences.
*   Generates step-by-step cooking instructions.
*   Creates a weekly grocery list with budget and nutrition filters.
*   (Stretch Goal) Integrates with a grocery delivery API.

**Proposed AWS Architecture:**

*   **Frontend:** React, Streamlit, or a chatbot interface.
*   **API Gateway:** Manages API requests.
*   **Lambda Functions:** Contain the core application logic.
*   **Amazon Bedrock:** Powers recipe generation and dietary suggestions.
*   **Bedrock AgentCore:** Orchestrates the different AI agents.
*   **DynamoDB:** Stores user data, preferences, and recipes.
*   **S3:** For storing user-uploaded images or pantry lists.
*   **SNS:** Sends notifications and reminders.
*   **External APIs:** Spoonacular or Edamam for nutritional data.

## GitHub Repository and Commit Strategy

To maintain a clean and organized project, we will follow a structured approach to version control.

### Repository Structure

```

### Commit Message Convention

We will use the following convention for commit messages to ensure clarity and consistency:

`feat:` - for new features
`fix:` - for bug fixes
`docs:` - for documentation changes
`style:` - for code formatting and style adjustments
`refactor:` - for code refactoring
`test:` - for adding or improving tests

**Example:** `feat: Implement initial recipe suggestion logic in Meal Planner agent`

## 15-Day Development Plan

This plan is designed to guide the development process from initial setup to a functional MVP, with stretch goals for further enhancement.
